        <h2>The unnamed girl</h2>
        <p> 
        me and this girl dated quite a while, but we got separated because she moved.<br>
        When I say a while, I mean around six months and she's perfect.<br>
        And we reconnected not too long ago and we went out and took photos. <br>
        I still like her a lot and she has a party soon, but I have anxiety with meeting new people.<br>
        I also asked her out to the movies and the problem is I wanna go to her party thing so she knows I care.<br>
        I mostly scared that our friends won't like me I am also scared that I might freeze up like I almost did in front of her mom.<br>
        That's all for right now 2:49.<br>
